This Crud Banking API aims to emulate the server side of a banking webapp. It allows 'clients' to perform CRUD operations via an HTTP API. I used JDBC to persist data in a PostgreSQL database, and Javalin to build the RESTful API. 

Interact with this API through Postman to register, login, deposit, withdraw, and transfer money between accounts.
